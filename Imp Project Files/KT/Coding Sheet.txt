Coding sheet 

It is used to define memory blocks of nvram
In NVRAM we store the non volatile data like calib data, parameters like constants,DID,DTC fault memory  etc
So we will be adding parameters in the excel sheet by defining different aspects in the excel then we generate using the coding sheet generator
and then copy it to 40 appl.

After adding a new parameter we need to reduce the added size of data from the RESERVE kept for that particular block
Also remove that many default value integer from the reserve row.

So when we generate , the parameters in the coding sheet get added to the c files accordingly.

Note: Take care of space and commas
